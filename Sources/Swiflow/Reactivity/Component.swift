/// A reactive UI building block.
///
/// Components are reference-typed (class-bound) so that property mutations
/// — typically driven by `@State` — are visible to the framework without
/// the caller having to return a new value. Instances live across renders
/// when the parent's diff finds a same-position, same-type, same-key match;
/// the diff calls `body` again on the reused instance and reconciles the
/// result against the previously-mounted body subtree.
///
/// Conforming types should:
/// 1. Implement `var body: VNode` — pure, synchronous, runs every render.
/// 2. Optionally override `onAppear`, `onChange`, `onDisappear`.
/// 3. Declare reactive state with `@State` (Task 2) — direct stored
///    properties work but don't trigger re-renders.
