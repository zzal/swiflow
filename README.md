## Why Swiflow?

React was the right answer to a constraint that no longer holds.
WebAssembly lets the work move from runtime to compile time, and Swiflow is a bet
on what that makes possible — reactivity with no ceremony, a typed UI with no
template language, hot reload that keeps your state, and a batched bridge that
keeps it fast, with ergonomics bought from compile-time power that's structurally
hard to copy. 2026 is a fair time to ask whether the old defaults are still the
best we can do. Swiflow is one answer worth a look.

**[Why Swiflow exists — a case for re-questioning the defaults →](WHY.md)**

> Swiflow is an independent project, built and maintained by one person as a
hands-on exploration of Swift on the web. It's **pre-1.0 and experimental** —
see the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for where things stand.

## Highlights

- **State-preserving HMR** — `swiflow dev` hot-swaps the running WASM on every save; `@State` survives, the page never reloads.
- **Reactive components** — `@Component` + `@State`, with `onAppear` / `onChange` / `onDisappear` lifecycle hooks firing across the whole tree.
- **Typed event DSL & bindings** — `.on(.click) { … }`; two-way `.value($text)`, `.checked($flag)`, `.selection($choice)`.
- **CSS-in-Swift** — a `css { }` builder, scoped `<style>` per component, and exit animations.
- **Routing** — `SwiflowRouter`: hash + history mode, `RouterRoot` / `Route` / `Link`, `@Environment(\.router)`.
- **Data layer** — `SwiflowQuery`: declarative data fetching with caching, request dedup, and stale-while-revalidate.
- **Forms** — `FormController` / `Field` with blur-triggered validation.
- **UI kit** — `SwiflowUI`: accessible, token-driven components that adapt to dark mode / contrast / reduced motion with no component code.
- **Testing** — `SwiflowTesting` headless harness (`render` / `click` / `input`); deterministic async via `AsyncTestHarness`.
- **DevTools** — a read-only browser **DevTools panel** (Chrome side panel + Safari Web Inspector) that x-rays the live component tree and `@State`; sideload it from [`devtools/`](devtools/).
- **Safe by default** — `URLSanitizer` scrubs `javascript:` / `data:` / `blob:` URLs at the DSL fold; `rawHTML(_:)` is the loud escape hatch.

## A component

```swift
import Swiflow
import SwiflowDOM

@MainActor @Component
final class Counter {
    @State var count = 0

    var body: VNode {
        div {
            p("Count: \(count)")
            button("Increment").on(.click) { self.count += 1 }
        }
    }
}

@main
struct App {
    @MainActor static func main() {
        Swiflow.render(into: "#app") { Counter() }
    }
}
```

A `@State` mutation schedules a re-render; the diff turns the new tree into one
batched patch list and ships it across the bridge in a single crossing.

## Quick start

You need **Swift 6.3** and the **WebAssembly Swift SDK 6.3.2** (the SDK's stdlib
must match the host compiler exactly). macOS 14+ for the dev server; Linux works too.

```bash
# 1. Install the WASM SDK (once)
swift sdk install \
  https://download.swift.org/swift-6.3.2-release/wasm-sdk/swift-6.3.2-RELEASE/swift-6.3.2-RELEASE_wasm.artifactbundle.tar.gz \
  --checksum a61f0584c93283589f8b2f42db05c1f9a182b506c2957271402992655591dd7c

# 2. Build the CLI (from source — no Homebrew yet)
swift build -c release --product swiflow

# 3. Scaffold and run, with state-preserving hot reload on every save
./.build/release/swiflow init my-app
cd my-app && ../.build/release/swiflow dev      # → http://localhost:3000
```

Run `swiflow doctor` to verify your toolchain. Hacking on Swiflow itself? Add
`--swiflow-source $(pwd)` to `init` so the new project depends on your local clone
instead of a published release.

## The ecosystem

| Module | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `Swiflow` | Pure-Swift VDOM core: `VNode`, the patch diff, `@State` / `@Component`, and the `@resultBuilder` DSL. |
| `SwiflowDOM` | WASM-only renderer + JavaScriptKit bridge. |
| `SwiflowRouter` | Hash- and history-mode routing. |
| `SwiflowQuery` | Async data layer — caching, dedup, stale-while-revalidate. |
| `SwiflowFetcher` | Thin `fetch` wrapper for requests from Swift. |
| `SwiflowStore` | Persisted app state (IndexedDB). |
| `SwiflowUI` | Token-driven, accessible component library. |
| `SwiflowTesting` | Headless test harness. |
| `swiflow` (CLI) | `init` scaffolds · `build` wraps `swift package js` · `dev` runs the HMR server. |

## Examples

Browse [`examples/`](examples/):

- **HelloWorld** — the starter: a counter, SwiflowUI controls, a native `<dialog>`, a popover, and toasts.
- **SwiflowUIDemo** — a gallery of the SwiflowUI components and theming.
- **TodoCRUD** — list CRUD with bindings and forms.
- **QueryDemo** — `SwiflowQuery` fetching and caching.
- **MiniRouter** — `SwiflowRouter` routes and links.
- **MissionControl** — a larger app: geolocated data with `SwiflowStore` persistence.
- **AsyncFetch** — `.task` async effects.

(Plus **EdgeCases**, a runtime/diff stress harness.) Serve one with `swiflow dev` from its directory.

A read-only **DevTools panel** (live component tree + `@State`) lives in
[`devtools/`](devtools/) — a Chrome side panel (sideload via
`chrome://extensions` → *Load unpacked*) and a Safari Web Inspector build
([`devtools/safari/`](devtools/safari/) needs an Xcode conversion).

## Performance & costs

- **First visit:** ~1.8 MB gzipped WASM on the wire (a loading-percent overlay shows during the download) — comparable to a modest single-page app. Every PR enforces a bundle-size budget in CI.
- **Repeat visits:** ~0 bytes — a service worker caches the WASM + JS runtime by content hash until you rebuild.
- **Hot rebuild:** ~8 s WASM rebuild → HMR swap, with `@State` preserved.

Measured on an Apple M1 Max with Swift 6.3 / WASM SDK 6.3.2 — run the commands
locally to calibrate for your hardware.

## Testing

```bash
swift test                   # ~1,000 Swift tests, 200+ suites (e2e auto-skips without the WASM SDK)
(cd js-driver && npm test)   # 42 jsdom tests: driver, dev reload, service worker
```

Playwright e2e (counter, router, progress overlay, SW cache) lives in
[`Tests/playwright/`](Tests/playwright/) and is opt-in.
