# Swiflow

Frontend ecosystem for Swift on the web: components, virtual DOM, hot-reloading
dev server, WASM output.

Swiflow batches all DOM mutations from a Swift-WASM render cycle into a single
patch list and ships them across the JS bridge in one leap — making
Swift-on-the-web fast and frictionless.

**Status:** Phase 5 (API Polish) complete. The framework is feature-complete
through Phase 3 (Component + `@State` reactivity + RAFScheduler), hardened
in Phase 4 (URL sanitizer, debug diagnostics, DWARF guide, JS-driver units,
Playwright e2e), and polished in Phase 5 — `@MainActor` Component, typed
`Event` enum, `.on(.click) { … }` handler API, `embed { … }`, factory-based
`Swiflow.render(into:) { Counter() }`, postfix VNode modifiers.

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Build the CLI.
swift build -c release --product swiflow

# 2. Scaffold a project.
./.build/release/swiflow init my-app --swiflow-source $(pwd)
cd my-app

# 3. Run the dev server — builds the WASM, serves on :3000, full-reload on save.
../.build/release/swiflow dev
# Open http://localhost:3000
```

For one-shot production builds, `swiflow build` wraps `swift package js` with
the right WASM SDK and toolchain auto-detection.

## Prerequisites

- **Swift 6.3** — `swift --version` should report 6.3.x. CI pins 6.3.0 because
  the WASM SDK's stdlib must match the host compiler exactly.
- **macOS 14+** (host requirement for the dev server, which uses Hummingbird 2.x).
  Linux works without a version pin.
- **WebAssembly Swift SDK 6.3** — install once via:
  ```bash
  swift sdk install \
    https://download.swift.org/swift-6.3-release/wasm-sdk/swift-6.3-RELEASE/swift-6.3-RELEASE_wasm.artifactbundle.tar.gz \
    --checksum 9fa4016ee632c7e9e906608ec3b55cf13dfc4dff44e47574c5af58064dc33fd9
  ```

## What's in the box

- **`Swiflow`** — pure-Swift VDOM core: tagged-enum `VNode`, 16-opcode `Patch`,
  hybrid keyed (LIS-based) + indexed children diff, `@resultBuilder` DSL.
- **`Component` + `@State`** — reactive class-bound components with a Mirror-wired
  `@State` property wrapper that calls into the per-frame `RAFScheduler` on
  mutation. Lifecycle hooks: `onAppear`, `onChange()`, `onDisappear`.
- **Security** — `URLSanitizer` scrubs `javascript:` / `vbscript:` / `data:` /
  `blob:` from `href`, `src`, `action`, `formaction` at the DSL fold step.
  `VNode.rawHTML(_:)` is the named-loud escape hatch.
- **Debug diagnostics** — `swiflowDiagnostic` (`#if DEBUG`, compiled to nothing in
  release) catches three programmer-error footguns: duplicate keys among
  siblings, mixed keyed/unkeyed siblings, component-body anchor cycles
  (depth ≥ 32).
- **`SwiflowWeb`** — WASM-only renderer + JavaScriptKit bridge.
- **`swiflow` CLI** — `init` scaffolds, `build` wraps `swift package js`, `dev`
  starts a Hummingbird HTTP + WebSocket server with file-watch full-reload.
- **JS driver** — vanilla JS, ~200 lines, embedded into the CLI binary as
  generated Swift code (single source of truth: `js-driver/swiflow-driver.js`).

## Architecture

See [docs/superpowers/specs/](docs/superpowers/specs/) for per-phase design
specs and [docs/superpowers/plans/](docs/superpowers/plans/) for the executable
implementation plans. [docs/brainstorm/](docs/brainstorm/) holds the original
design exploration.

## Testing

```bash
swift test
```

281 tests across 59 suites. Tests that require the WASM SDK end-to-end are
gated and skip cleanly when it's absent.
